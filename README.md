# HCC's Coding Club Discord Bot

# What is this? (Original ReadME)

This is a Discord bot designed around modules to make adding features as easy as possible for inexperienced developers.

Using reflection, modules can be added with just a single class file and features can be added with just a single method.

With additional utilities like `@InjectStatic`, it allows the programmer to pass static fields between classes without getters, setters, or class instances.

The purpose of this project is to take load off the inexperienced developer in learning the Java language and JDA. With this, the developer can focus on the features they want to add to their bot.
